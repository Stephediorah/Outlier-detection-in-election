# Outlier-detection-in-election
This report presents a geospatial analysis of election data to identify outliers among polling units. The aim of this report is to detect significant deviations in voting patterns for different parties, identify the most anomalous polling units, and provide explanations for these anomalies.

**CONCLUSION**

Based on the vote trends of the polling units for various parties, this research was able to identify notable outliers. Potential explanations for the deviations of the top outliers were revealed through their visualization and highlight. Important realizations consist of:

- Polling Unit-1 had significantly higher votes for each party compared to its neighboring units.
- Targeted campaigning and local events can significantly impact voting patterns.
- Demographic factors and local issues play a crucial role in shaping voter behavior.
- Further investigation into these outliers can provide deeper insights into electoral dynamics and inform future campaign strategies.
- The highest outlier score suggests an unusual surge in votes, possibly due to targeted campaigning or local issues that resonated with voters.

  The Result includes a csv with longitude and latitude values for each polling unit. Then calculated outlier scores, a report on the findings.
